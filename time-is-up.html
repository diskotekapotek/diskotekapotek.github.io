Time's Up (2019)<br><br>
<b>About the work:</b><br><br>
"Hannes and I always liked the idea of giving idiot answers to complex questions and complex answers to idiot questions. We followed this stance all the way from writing the song to finishing the video. 
<br><br>

At it's most basic stage, the idea came from a no-brainer experience of coming up (with slight chemical aid) on a dance floor and worrying about the comedown as soon as the initial high passed. I thought that this theme, of the unavoidable passing of a good thing making that very good thing impossible to enjoy, had to do with an obsession of time. I felt the same way about some instances of love, in which one can only enjoy it for a minute before worrying about the inevitable end. And, in the most dramatic form, worrying about death right after being born. The tendency to start counting the days as soon as you’ve been alive long enough to learn how to measure the thing that will inevitably lead to your end. 
<br><br>
The whole thing turned into a difficult question of what one is really obsessed with when one is obsessed with time. We attempted to portray this in a complex way: we would have a video of this obsessive amateur neuroscientist stranded in a sort of time void trying to regain the notion of time. In equal fear and worship of the clock he tries to figure it out by using electroencephalography brain scans to trace neurons on a millisecond-level, running computations to approximate the analogs to digitals, simulating neural networks on a Macintosh SE30, applying critical deconstruction on physicists Carlo Rovelli’s lectures of Time… and getting absolutely nowhere. Directing it, me and Hannes found that we were too stupid to say anything insightful on the subject. As a result of that, the video ended up as an obscure mess. Finally, we thought this was perfect since maybe the best answer that can be given to questions about time is the idiot’s answer, that time is an obscure mess."
